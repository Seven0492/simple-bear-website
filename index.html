        <h3>What does a typical Brown bear <span class="green">habitat</span> look like?</h3>
        <p>Brown bears are the most widely distributed bear species in the world.<br />
          They <em>can</em> be found in such remote or extreme areas as the fringes of deserts, high mountain forests
          and ice fields.<br /><br />
          They can be said to be more adventurous than <em>most</em> contemporary Humans today, such a chock!
        </p>
        <p>But Brown bears have their favorite picks too! Depending on the continent they are:
        </p><br />
        <ul>
          <li>Europe: These european one's prefer their mountain woodlands,<br />
            with precious nectar (Honey before being processed) over there,
            maybe playing the king of the hills bear equivalent, I wonder.</li><br />
          <li>Siberia: These one's are more old school, preferring plain old forests.</li><br />
          <li>North America: They prefer tundra's, alpine meadows and coastlines.</li>

    <h2>This is my first website!</h2>
    <p>You probably don't find it good but at least I bothered doing semantic html,
      I could have just ignored the advice and continued with non-semantic.
      Anyway, one day I'm gonna have a blog website, I know it!</p>
