# simple-bear-website

By Seven#2672

This is my first website, I'm gonna update it to test what I've learned once in a while,

feel free to post issues, start discussions and pull requests as you wish.

# Archived

I'm going to archive this repo as I've stopped being really interested in html, css and Javacript.

It was unfortunately a temporary interest, I invite you to fork the project if you want to make your own based off of mine, It would be my pleasure.

# How to take part in testing

It's hosted on Github pages, PHP doesn't work, but you can access it here: https://seven0492.github.io/simple-bear-website/. (No longer up)

You can clone the Github repository and open the 'index.html' file in the browser.

Ex: 'file://$PATH/index.html'

# Contributing

You can contribute by proposing modifications in a pull request and discuss the modifications with me.
